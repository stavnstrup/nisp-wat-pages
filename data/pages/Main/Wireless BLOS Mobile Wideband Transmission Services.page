|title=Wireless BLOS Mobile Wideband Transmission Services
|description=The Wireless Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Mobile Wideband Transmission Services support the wireless data of amongst two or more nodes, where one or more of the nodes are operating on the move, within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands, and employing wideband high capacity wireless terminals operating in the SHF frequency band and the C band (4 to 8 GHz) and NATO military band IV (4.4 to 5 GHz).

Examples of Wireless BLOS Mobile Wideband Transmission Services are SHF Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM), SHF Medium Data Rate (MDR) Military Satellite Communications (MILCOM) Jam-Resistant Modem, Satellite Broadcast Service (SBS), and Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), all with the consideration that adequate tracking antennas are employed and the transceivers are adapted for platform motion.
