==Introduction==
The '''Subobjects''' allow to add/edit/view a dynamic set of sub-records on a Concept page (e.g. list of departments in the company, each department is described by a set of properties).

The definition of the Subobject consists of two elements:
* '''definition of the Subobject structure''': one of the Concepts defined in the <nowiki><concepts></nowiki> section of the Data Model (see [[Help:Data Model|Data Model]] for more details) with type="Internal"
* '''intent of using subobject in a specific Concept''': subobject element in the Concept "structure" element (among property elements)

Styling of the Subobject is defined in the Concept element which represents Subobject structure. See [[Help:Concept Styling|Concept Styling]] for more details.


==Definition==
<pre>
  ...
    <concept name="A">
      <structure>
        ...
        <subobject name="{NAME}" attribute="{ATTRIBUTE}" concept="{CONCEPT NAME}" label="{LABEL}"/>
        ...
      </structure>
    </concept>

    <concept name="{CONCEPT NAME}" type="Internal">

        <property name="Property 1"/>
        <property name="Property 2"/>
        <property name="Property 3"/>
        <customView>

==Semantic database==
The Subobject meta-data are NOT being defined/represented in the semantic database.

Only data created using generated Concept/Subobject forms are stored in the semantic database:
* Each Subobject Record is stored on the Concept Data Entity page
* Each Subobject Record gets automatically assigned UUID (global unique identifier)
* Each Subobject Record stores a set of Subobject properties (if provided by the user/imported by the script).


==Example==
<pre>
   ...
      <concept name="Test Case">
        <structure>
          ...
          <subobject name="Test Steps" concept="Test Step" label="Steps"/>
          ...
        </structure>
      </concept>

      <concept name="Test Step" type="Internal">
        <structure layout="table">
          <property name="Property 1"/>
          <property name="Property 2"/>
          <property name="Property 3"/>
        </structure>
      </concept>

</pre>


==User Interface==
* '''View Page'''
The Subobject is displayed as a table, list or using custom template. The layout is controlled by the style/layout attribute of the Subobject Concept.

* '''Edit Page'''
The Subobject provides a dedicated section on the page which allows to edit and delete sub-records.
The section provides also a button to create a new sub-record.

* '''Search Page'''
Displaying subobjects in the search results table is not supported.

UYsing subobjects as a search filter is not suppported.
