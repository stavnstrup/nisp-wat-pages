This document discusses some of the problems encountered when working with the date, time, and dateTime values from XML Schema when those value include (or omit) time zone offsets. Many W3C technologies rely on date and time types. Examples of these include the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators specifications, since these are the basis for XQuery and XSLT processing of date/time values, but the concepts presents affect any datetime processing.
