|description=
This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for discovering information about other XMPP entities. Two kinds of information can be discovered: (1) the identity and capabilities of an entity, including the protocols and features it supports; and (2) the items associated with an entity, such as the list of rooms hosted at a multi-user chat service.
