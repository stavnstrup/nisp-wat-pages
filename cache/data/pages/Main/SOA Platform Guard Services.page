|title=SOA Platform Guard Services
|description=The SOA Platform Guard Services connect networks of different security policy and usage areas to control traffic flow in-between the networks following a set of predefined rules for SOA services. The intended function is to allow automated data exchange between two network enclaves that belong to different security domains. From the guard's perspective one enclave is defined as high security domain and the other enclave as the low security domain.

In cross-domain information exchange scenario the following threats to the high security domain are recognized: leakage of confidential information from the high security domain to the low security domain and degradation of the integrity or availability of resources in the high security domain

The purpose of the SOA Platform Services is to enable a cross-domain information exchange by mediating traffic flows, while offering sufficient protection against the threats mentioned above by enforcing an appropriate access control policy.
