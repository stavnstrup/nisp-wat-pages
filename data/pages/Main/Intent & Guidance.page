|description=The "Intent & Guidance" are composed of a collection of information products that are processed and created for the representation of the intentions and key directions issued by a leader.  Intent provides the keystone doctrine for the planning, execution and support of Allied operations. The intent defines the end-state in relation to the factors of mission; adversary, operating environment, terrain, forces, time and preparation for future operations. As such, it addresses what results are expected from the operation, how these results might enable transition to future operations, and how, in broad terms, a commander expects the force to achieve those results. Its focus is on the force as a whole. Additional information on how the force will achieve the desired results is provided only to clarify the commanderâ€™s intentions.  Guidance provides the instructions and advice on the execution of plans, operations, and support of operational activities.
