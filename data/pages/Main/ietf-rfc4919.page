|description=
6LoWPAN is the evolving model that is aimed at allowing IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from PANs, more specifically over IEEE 802.15.4-standard based networks. IPv6 is the work horse for data delivery for wired networks- the internet. Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing communication-ability in the wireless domain.Status: A working group under ITEF1 has developed a draft to be submitted to IESG for consideration of publication as Proposed Standard.
