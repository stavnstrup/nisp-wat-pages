==Introduction==
The '''Bugzilla Type''' represents bugzilla issues for specific products and components.

It assumes the following syntax to be entered as a text value of the property:
<pre>
#<PRODUCT NAME>;
<VERSION><COMPONENT NAME>;
<VERSION><COMPONENT NAME>;
...
#<PRODUCT NAME>;
<VERSION><COMPONENT NAME>;
<VERSION><COMPONENT NAME>;
...
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
#FMN Spiral 3 Specification;
Draft FMN Spiral 3 Service Instructions for Geospatial Information;
Draft FMN Spiral 3 Procedural Instructions for Recognized Environmental Picture;
#FMN Spiral 2 Specification;
Final FMN Spiral 2 Service Instructions for Geospatial Information;

==Definition==
The Bugzilla Property extends a common definition of the [[Help:Property|Property Definition]] with the following elements:

<pre>
<property ... rows={ROWS} ...>
</property>
</pre>

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {ROWS}
| A number of initially displayed rows. Default value: 5.
|}


==Semantic database==
The Bugzilla Property is implemented as a [[Special:Types/Text]] datatype.


==Example==
<pre>
<property name="Bugzilla issues" type="Bugzilla" label="Components" attribute="components">
  <description>Bugzilla issues.</description>
  <instruction/>
</property>
</pre>


==User Interface==
* '''View Page'''
The property displays a matrix with the bugzilla issues in a rows and a number of issues in various states in the columns.

* '''Edit Page'''
The property provides a multi-line text input field to enter the definition of the required components.
A number of initially displayed rows is controlled by the "rows" attribute.

* '''Search Page'''
The property allows user to choose a search operator from the following options: ''Starts with, Contains, Equals, Ends with, Has any value''
