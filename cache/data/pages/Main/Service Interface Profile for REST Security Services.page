This specification provides the profile for securing representational state transfer (REST) web services (known as RESTful web services) that are deployed within the NNEC web service infrastructure. It specifies security requirements that need to be accounted for depending on the environment in which the services are being deployed, and the level of assurance required for protecting those services. This profile covers the required security protection profile for a Client to access protected resources on a Resource Server using REST.
