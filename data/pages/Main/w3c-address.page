|description=
WS-Addressing provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address Web services and messages. Specifically, this specification defines XML [XML 1.0, XML Namespaces] elements to identify Web service endpoints and to secure end-to-end endpoint identification in messages. This specification enables messaging systems to support message transmission through networks that include processing nodes such as endpoint managers, firewalls, and gateways in a transport-neutral manner.
