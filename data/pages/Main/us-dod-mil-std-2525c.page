|description=
The mil standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of Land Component Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. It addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.
