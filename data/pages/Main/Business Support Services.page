|description=The Business Support Services provide the means to facilitate other service and data providers on the enterprise network by providing and managing underlying capabilities for collaboration and information management. These services are enablers used by other services and users across the whole network-enabled enterprise, acting as "building blocks" for developing more sophisticated Community Of Interest (COI) services and applications. Therefore, they are COI independent and they must be available to all enterprise members.
