|title=Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: Extensions
|dateissued=1997
|substandards=
|description=
This Recommendation | International Standard is applicable to continuous-tone grayscale or colour digital still image data. It is applicable to a wide range of applications which require use of compressed images.This Recommendation | International Standard:



* defines extensions [including variable quantization, selective refinement, tiling, and a Still Picture Interchange File Format (SPIFF)] to processes for converting Source image data to compressed image data;

* defines extensions to processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;

* defines coded representations for compressed image data;

* gives guidance and examples on how to implement these extensions in practice;

* describes compliance tests for these extensions.
