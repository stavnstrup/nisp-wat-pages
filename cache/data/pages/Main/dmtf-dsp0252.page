|description=
Many organizations are striving to base IT management on a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). A CMDB contains data describing the following entities:

* managed resources, such as computer systems and application software

* process artifacts, such as incident, problem, and change records

* relationships among managed resources and process artifacts

The contents of the CMDB should be managed by a configuration management process and serve as the foundation for other IT management processes, such as change management and availability management.
