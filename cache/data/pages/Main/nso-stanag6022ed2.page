|description=
The aim of this STANAG is to define a meteorological message for gridded meteorological data, and to standardise the number of information digits and their meanings, for use by the Armed Forces of any country. This will make it possible for the Armed Forces of all NATO nations to be able to receive gridded meteorological data for operational use in S4 software within Artillery fire control systems, NBC Automated Warning, Reporting and Prediction Systems (NBC AWRAPS), and various computer-based Battlefield (or Tactical) Decision Aids (BDAs).
