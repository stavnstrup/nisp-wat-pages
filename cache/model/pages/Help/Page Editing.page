==Introduction==
There are several security measures implemented to protect pages from editing them by not authorized users:
* protection of Application Pages,
* protection of Data Pages,
** deactivation of "Edit" button for Concepts with Form defined,
** protection of parts of the Concept data model


==Protection of generated Application Pages==
By default all generated pages are locked (protected) and only administrators can edit them.<br/>


==Protection of Data Pages==
===Deactivation of "Edit" button===
By default the "Edit" button for Concepts with generated Form is disabled for the regular users.

The regular users can edit page data only through the "Edit with form" capability.

Administrators are provided with both options.<br/>


===Protection of parts of the Concept data model===
The Wiki Automation Tool provides a '''Conditional''' capability which allows to protect parts of the Concept data model:
* display parts of the page on the View Page
* make these parts editable on the Edit Page
'''only if certain conditions are met'''.

The Conditional capability also allows to define power users group which should be able to see/edit these parts of the data model regardless of these conditions.

See [[Help:Conditional|Conditional]] and [[Help:User Groups|User Groups]] for more details.
