==Introduction==
Data entities of various Concepts might be organized in different hierarchies: '''tree''' or '''forest'''.

In the "tree" hierarchy each data entity can have one parent data entity, while in the "forest" hierarchy each data entity can have multiple parents.

The Wiki Automation Tool provides additional hierarchical visualizations for Concepts which data are organized in one of these hierarchies.


==Definition==
<pre>
<concept name="{CONCEPT}" ... hierarchy="{HIERARCHY TYPE}">
</concept>
</pre>

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {CONCEPT}
| A short name of the 'Concept.
|-
! {HIERARCHY TYPE}
| A type of the hierarchy supported by given Concept. Allowed values <nowiki>[tree|forest]</nowiki>.
|}


==Semantic database==
For Concepts supporting "tree" hierarchy, additional '''Is child of''' property is added to each data entity.
This property is used to refer to the parent data entity.

For Concepts supporting "forest" hierarchy, additional '''Is parent of''' property is added to each data entity.
This property is used to refer to all children of given data entity.


==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="Service" hierarchy="tree">
  <structure>
    <property name="Name"/>
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>

In the example above all Service instances (data entities) are organized in a tree structure.
Each Service might be broken down into more detailed Services (which would refer to its parent using "Is child of" property).


==User Interface==
For Concepts supporting hierarchical data the following visualization are provided:
* on the '''Edit Page''' additional input field is added to capture information about the parent (for "tree" hierarchy) or children (for "forest" hierarchy)
* on the '''View Page''' additional section (called "Context") is added. This section displays a simple graph presenting a parent(s) and children of the current page.
* new '''Tree Page''' is generated. The page displays entire tree of all data entities for given Concept.
