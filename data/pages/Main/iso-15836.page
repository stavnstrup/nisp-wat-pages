|description=
ISO 15836:2009 establishes a standard for cross-domain resource description, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. Like RFC 3986, ISO 15836:2009 does not limit what might be a resource. ISO 15836:2009 defines the elements typically used in the context of an application profile which constrains or specifies their use in accordance with local or community-based requirements and policies. However, it does not define implementation detail, which is outside the scope of ISO 15836:2009
