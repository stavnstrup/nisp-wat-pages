They facilitate an efficient and effective environment for coordination and cooperation between those users in achieving some determined and meaningful outcome to shared activities. The capabilities they support include conferencing, digital messaging, collaborative working and social networking. 

Communication and Collaboration Applications support tailored User Interfaces specific to the communication channel and tool to be used and the collaborative activity to be undertaken. Functionality to communicate, access and provision information may be limited or enhanced depending upon the Technical Services delivering them, the User Appliances supporting them and the User Equipment (metadata) of consumers accessing them.

Indeed, these applications are often provided in a single package as unified messaging and collaboration platforms.
