=Governance Perspectives=
Governance perspectives are aimed at providing a comprehensive view of the entire NISP content.			

=Coherence Perspectives=
Coherence perspectives are generated to report the level of coherence of architectural data. Some of the perspectives consist of an overview of taxonomy concepts such as Business Processes, Information Products, User Applications and Technical Services, Other useful perspectives describe the definition of taxonomy layers, specifically the layers in the Technical Services Framework. Finally, specific coherence reports provide valuable feedback about possible incoherence and inconsistency in architectural data and the definition of taxonomy elements.

The primary audience for these perspectives are NATO architects, whos role it is to continuously improve the architectural data and map the NATO C3 landscape.
