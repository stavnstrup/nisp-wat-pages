This specification provides requirements for the preparation and use of the Raster Product Format(RPF) Compressed ARC Digitized Raster Graphics (CADRG) data. CADRG is a general purpose product, comprising computer-readable digital map and chart images. It supports various weapons, C3I theater battle management, mission planning, and digital moving map systems. CADRG data is derived directly from ADRG and other digital sources through downsampling, filtering, compression, and reformatting to the RPF standard. CADRG files are physically formatted within a National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) message.
