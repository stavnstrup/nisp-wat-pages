|title=Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6
|dateissued=1999

|description=
This document specifies the protocol used by an IPv6 router to discover the presence of multicast listeners (that is, nodes wishing to receive multicast packets) on its directly attached links, and to discover specifically which multicast addresses are of interest to those neighboring nodes. This protocol is referred to as Multicast Listener Discovery or MLD. MLD is derived from version 2 of IPv4's Internet Group Management Protocol, IGMPv2. One important difference to note is that MLD uses ICMPv6 (IP Protocol 58) message types, rather than IGMP (IP Protocol 2) message types.
