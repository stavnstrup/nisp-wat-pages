|title=Wireless BLOS Static Wideband Transmission Services
|description=The Wireless Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Static Wideband Transmission Services support the wireless transfer of data amongst two or more static nodes Beyond Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands, and employing wideband high capacity wireless terminals operating in the SHF frequency band and the C band (4 to 8 GHz) and NATO military band IV (4.4 to 5 GHz).

Examples of Wireless BLOS Static Wideband Transmission Services are SHF Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM), SHF Medium Data Rate (MDR) Military Satellite Communications (MILCOM) Jam-Resistant Modem, Satellite Broadcast Service (SBS), Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), and troposcatter services operating in the 4 to 5 GHz range (i.e. C band) up to a distance of approximately 300 km.
