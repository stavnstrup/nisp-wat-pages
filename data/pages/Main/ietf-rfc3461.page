|description=
eSMTP defines an extension to the SMTP service, which allows an SMTP client to specify

* that delivery status notifications (DSNs) should be generated under certain conditions,

* whether such notifications should return the contents of the message, and

* additional information, to be returned with a DSN, that allows the sender to identify both the recipient(s) for which the DSN was issued, and the transaction in which the original message was sent.
