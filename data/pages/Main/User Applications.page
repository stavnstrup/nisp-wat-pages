|description=The "User Applications" taxonomy layer represents the collection of applications - also known as application software, software applications, applications or "apps" - that enable users to perform singular or multiple related tasks through the provision of functionally designed computer software components. User Applications in the C3 Taxonomy are defined just up to a level of detail enough to describe what they need to do in order to manage data (process Information Products) and to present information to the human and computer actors in the enterprise (support Business Processes).

User Applications provide the logical interface between human and automated activities. They are executed on User Equipment.

The applications and their supporting Back-End Capabilities are defined without any constrains from or references to actual technology implementations. User Applications change over time to reflect changes in their supported business processes and independently of the evolution of technology.
