|title=XEP-0068: Field Standardization for Data Forms
|dateissued=2012-05-28

|description=
XMPP extensions that reuse Data Forms (XEP-0004), such as Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045) and Ad-Hoc Commands (XEP-0050), typically need a way to gather data from both humans (using a GUI format) and computer processes (using a pre-defined but flexible format). The 'jabber:x:data' namespace provides an adequate mechanism for both of these uses, as long as computer processes can rely on the var="" names on a particular type of form. This document defines a mechanism for the XMPP Registrar to standardize the field names in such forms, thus enabling XMPP clients to process forms as they have to this point while giving protocol authors a way to specify a mechanism for non-GUI processors to determine the semantic meanings of forms and their constituent fields.
