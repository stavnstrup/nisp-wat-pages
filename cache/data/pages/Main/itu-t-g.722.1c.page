|description=
ITU standard G.722.1C algorithm offers breakthrough benefits compared to earlier wideband audio technology. G.722.1C delivers low-latency 14 kHz super-wideband audio at nearly half the bitrate of the alternative MPEG4 AAC-LD codec, while requiring one-tenth of the computing power. G.722.1C also compares favorably to other algorithms, including MPEG4, eACC+ and AMR-WB+. As a result extra processor cycles are available for improved video quality or Internet applications, and batteries will last longer on mobile devices.
