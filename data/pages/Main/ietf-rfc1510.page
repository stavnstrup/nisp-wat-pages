|description=
This document gives an overview and specification of Version 5 of the protocol for the Kerberos network authentication system. Kerberos provides a means of verifying the identities of principals, (e.g., a workstation user or a network server) on an open (unprotected) network. This is accomplished without relying on authentication by the host operating system, without basing trust on host addresses, without on the network, and under the assumption that packets traveling along the network can be read, modified, and inserted at will.
