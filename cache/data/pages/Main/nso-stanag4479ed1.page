|description=
The aim of this STANAG is to define:

* The voice digitizer characteristics, the coding tables and the bit format requirements at 800 bps;

* The error correction scheme and the interleaver to ensure compatability of digital voice produced using an overall bit rate of 2400 bps for slow frequency hopping HF-EPM transmission; and

* The End Of Transmission sequence for slow frequency hopping HF-EPM transmission.

The point 1 and the annexes A, B, C, D of the STANAG describe a 800 bps coder useable as a stand alone voice coder in any transmission system needing a low bit rate order.

The points 2 and 3 (and the related annexes F, G, H, I of the STANAG) are specifically aimed at transmission of the afore mentioned coder with the slow frequency hopping HF-EPM waveform.
