This document specifies the interface to a Web Processing Service (WPS). WPS defines a standardized interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes, and the discovery of and binding to those processes by clients. ―Processes‖ include any algorithm, calculation or model that operates on spatially referenced data. ―Publishing‖ means making available machine-readable binding information as well as humanreadable metadata that allows service discovery and use.
