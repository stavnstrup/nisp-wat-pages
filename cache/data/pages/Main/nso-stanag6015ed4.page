|description=
The purpose of this manual is to describe in detail the Standard NATO Meteorological Codes, and those national exceptions to the Meteorological Airfield Report (METAR) Code, the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) Code and the Airfield Weather Colour Code used in NATO. In some circumstances, it is recognized that information on the weather may be used for internal national or command use. These differences from standard codes are not detailed in this publication. In addition, examples of codes used in NATO that contain meteorological information, but are not meteorological codes, are listed for completeness.
