|description=
This STANAG defines the gateway protocols that enable a TFN to interoperate with a non- TACOMS network (tactical, strategic, or public) through an ENAP. The various ENAPs are introduced in the TACOMS Head STANAG 4637 and listed in Table 1. Table 1 also presents the service provided by the ENAP.The mapping of the services across the gateways is also specified, as is the mapping between the TACOMS protocols (e.g., call processing, signalling, numbering, and naming) and the protocols applicable to each ENAP.
