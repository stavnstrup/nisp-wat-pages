|title=Frame-based Access Services
|description=The Frame-based Access Services provide the delivery or exchange of user data, end-to-end, formatted and encapsulated into frames (e.g. Ethernet frames, PPP frames). The frames are delivered by the user end-point, adapted transported by the relevant Transport Service or Transmission Service, and dispatched to the Communications Access Service at the other end-point(s), transparently (i.e. frame contents are not altered, and frame headers are not looked-up for switching purposes). In other words, user end-points are agnostic to the service class and type selected  by the Service Provider, provided the delivery of frames end-to-end is seamless and does not interfere with protocols at the same layer.
