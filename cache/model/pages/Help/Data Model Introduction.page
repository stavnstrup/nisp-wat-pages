The '''Data Model''':
* defines a set of '''Concepts''' relevant for a specific domain
** each Concept represents a single data entity (data structure)
** related Concepts are grouped by '''Packages'''
** Concepts might be related (linked) to other Concepts (e.g. Cities are located in Countries)
** Concepts might create hierarchy of similar Concepts (e.g. Tracks, Convertibles, SUVs concepts are subclasses of Car concept and thus are considered cars as well)
** each Concept is composed of a set of '''Properties''', which store singe data attribute
** each Concept might manage '''Subobjects''': embedded sub-records which are being a part of the data entity (e.g. Car's Parts)
* Subobject, like Concept, is composed of a set of '''Properties''', which store singe data attribute
* defines a set of common Properties which are shared/reused across all Concepts
** each Property has a specific Property Type
* supports the following '''Property Types''': String, Text, Boolean, Number, Date, Page, Option, URL, File, Image, Geographic coordinates, Bugzilla
