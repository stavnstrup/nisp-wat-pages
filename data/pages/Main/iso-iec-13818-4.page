|description=
ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004 specifies how tests can be designed to verify whether coded data and decoders meet requirements specified in parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818.Characteristics of coded data and decoders are defined for parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818. The capabilities of a decoder specify which coded data the decoder can decode and reconstruct, by defining the subset of the standard that may be exploited in the coded data. Coded data can be decoded by a decoder if the characteristics of the coded data are within the subset of the standard specified by the decoder capabilities.

Procedures are described for testing conformance of coded data and decoders to the requirements defined in parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818. Given the set of characteristics claimed, the requirements that must be met are fully determined by parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818. ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004 summarizes the requirements, cross references them to characteristics, and defines how conformance with them can be tested.

A set of conformance test sequences implemented according to those guidelines are provided as an electronic annex to ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004.
