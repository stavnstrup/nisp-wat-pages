|description=
The DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) is an approach to the management of systems and networks that applies the basic structuring and conceptualization techniques of the object-oriented paradigm. The approach uses a uniform modeling formalism that - together with the basic repertoire of object-oriented constructs - supports the cooperative development of an object-oriented schema across multiple organizations. A management schema is provided to establish a common conceptual framework at the level of a fundamental typology - both with respect to classification and association, and with respect to a basic set of classes intended to establish a common framework for a description of the managed environment.
