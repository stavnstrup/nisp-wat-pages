|description=
DFS is the fundamental element for information sharing in DCE-enabled networks. It unites the file systems of all network nodes for a consistent interface, making global file access as easy as local access. It replicates files and directories on multiple network machines for fast and reliable access. DFS also caches copies of currently used files at the requesting node to minimise network traffic and provide fast data access.
