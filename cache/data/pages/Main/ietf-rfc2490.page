|title=A Simulation Model for IP Multicast with RSVP
|dateissued=1999
|substandards=
|description=
This document describes a detailed model of IPv4 multicast with RSVP that has been developed using the OPNET simulation package, with protocol procedures defined in the C language. The model was developed to allow investigation of performance constraints on routing but should have wide applicability in the Internet multicast/resource reservation community. We are making this model publicly available with the intention that it can be used to provide expanded studies of resource-reserved multicasting.
