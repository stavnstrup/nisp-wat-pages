|description=The Mediation Services provide a middle layer between incompatible producers of information and consumers of information. Mediation services process the data of the information producer and transform it into a representation which is understandable for the consumer. In doing so Mediation Services bridge the gap between both parties, enabling interaction between them which has not been possible beforehand.
