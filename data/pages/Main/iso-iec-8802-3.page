|description=
The above standard is applicable to systems requiring LAN services. CSMA/CD has seen wide adoption throughout the world, especially in the form of Ethernet. The most common form is a 10Mbps star topology (10BaseT, twisted pair), although a 100Mbps variant (Fast Ethernet, or 100BaseT) is about to see increased use. Ethernet users simply put traffic on the network and if traffic clashes (collides) with other users' traffic then users will back off and wait for a random period before retrying.
