|description=
This STANAG defines the technical interoperability characteristics for a means of digital communications over maritime HF radio channels having a bandwidth of 1240 Hz. The effective bit rate of the communication can be 75, 150, 300, 600 or 1200 bits per second, bya means of a single tone modulator / demodulator in combination with error correction techniques. In addition, uncoded data transmission modes at 600, 1200 and 1800 bps are defined. This STANAG has been developed with the objective of implementation of the capability by upgrading exisiting STANAG 4285 or STANAG 4481 equipments to contain this means as another user-selectaqble mode.
