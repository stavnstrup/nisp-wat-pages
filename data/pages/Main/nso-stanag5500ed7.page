|description=
FORMETS is a collection of character-oriented information procedural standards suitable for the efficient exchange of information. The system includes the syntax and rules governing the representation of agreed conceptual definitions (fields), and the arrangement of these fields into sentences (sets) and message texts. FORMETS is intended to be used for all formatted character-oriented messages within the NATO Command, Control and Information System (NCCIS).ADatP-3 CONFORMETS provides all required guidance to define Message Text Formats (MTF). CONFORMETS also specifies XML-MTF family of technical specifications as they are applied to ADatP-3 MTF to produce equivalent derived XML-MTF formats. ADatP-3 is covered by STANAG 5500.

The ADatP-3 Database contains all Message Text Formats under configuration control of the MTFWG.

The agreed MTFs, once published in a Baseline, will regularly be inserted into STANAG 7149, NATO Message Catalogue ? APP-11, current edition.
