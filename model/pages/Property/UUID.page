A 16-byte (128-bit) number in 5 groups separated by hyphens, compliant with RFC 4122.

A "Universally Unique IDentifier" (UUID) is an identifier standard used in software construction. The intent of UUIDs is to enable distributed systems to uniquely identify information without significant central coordination. Information labeled with UUIDs can be combined into a single database without needing to resolve identifier (ID) conflicts.

	A UUID is a 16-octet (128-bit) number. In its canonical form, a UUID is represented by 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens). For example: "7269c09d-b748-4c36-8713-2f0cb2fb1885".

	Within the context of the Enterprise Mapping wiki, the UUID does not play a role in the semantic relationshis between concepts. They are introduced for post-processing datadumps from the wiki.

	Note: The UUIDs are automatically generated by our software. Do not make any changes to assigned values. UUIDs are not visible on forms. If you would consider to edit templates with UUID entries (and not using the appropriate form) the use default value "null", that will later invoke the assignment of a true UUID value.

This is a property of type [[Has type::String]].
