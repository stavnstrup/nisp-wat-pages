|description=
A Web Coverage Service supports the networked interchange of geospatial data as coverages (i.e. raster, matrix and imagery data). Unlike a Web Map Service which filters and portrays geospatial data to return static maps (server-rendered as pictures), the Web Coverage Service provides access to intact (unrendered) geospatial information, as needed for client-side rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into scientific models and other clients beyond simple viewers. It can:

* Distribute geospatial raster data in standardised formats (e.g. GeoTIFF)

* Answer basic queries about the coverages

* Tell other programs what capabilities the service can perform
