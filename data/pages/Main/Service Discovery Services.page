|description=The Service Discovery Services enable a requester to discover a target service that matches certain functional and non-functional requirements. In this context discovery is the act of locating a service description of target service(s) which contain information about the (syntactic and semantic) interface of the service and other (non-functional) aspects of its service contract.  The resulting service description is sufficient to inform a consumer on the mechanism required to bind to an instance of the target service.
