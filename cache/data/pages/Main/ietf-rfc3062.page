|description=
The integration of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and external authentication services has introduced non-DN authentication identities and allowed for non-directory storage of passwords. As such, mechanisms which update the directory (e.g., Modify) cannot be used to change a user's password. This document describes an LDAP extended operation to allow modification of user passwords which is not dependent upon the form of the authentication identity nor the password storage mechanism used.
