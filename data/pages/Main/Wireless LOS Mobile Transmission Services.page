|title=Wireless LOS Mobile Transmission Services
|description=The Wireless Line of Sight (LOS) Mobile Transmission Services support the wireless data of amongst two or more nodes, where one or more of the nodes are operating on the move, within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands. Selection of frequency bands is based on coverage, capacity, propagation, transceiver attributes, and frequency coordination constraints.

In the context of these services, a distinction is made between transmission over an optical/visual LOS path (i.e. free of any form of visual obstruction), and a virtual LOS path (i.e. a straight line through visually obstructing material) - also referred to as Non- or Near- LOS (NLOS).
