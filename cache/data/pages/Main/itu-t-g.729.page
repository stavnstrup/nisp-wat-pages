|description=
Rec. ITU-T G.729 contains the description of an algorithm for the coding of speech signals at 8 kbit/s using Conjugate-Structure Algebraic-Code-Excited Linear-Prediction (CS-ACELP). This coder is designed to operate with a digital signal obtained by first performing telephone bandwidth filtering (Rec. ITU-T G.712) of the analogue input signal, then sampling it at 8000 Hz, followed by conversion to 16-bit linear PCM for the input to the encoder. The output of the decoder should be converted back to an analogue signal by similar means. Other input/output characteristics, such as those specified by Rec. ITU-T G.711 for 64 kbit/s PCM data, should be converted to 16-bit linear PCM before encoding, or from 16-bit linear PCM to the appropriate format after decoding. The bitstream from the encoder to the decoder is defined within this Recommendation.
