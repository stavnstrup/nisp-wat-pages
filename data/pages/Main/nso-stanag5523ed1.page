|description=
The prime purpose of the NATO CorpDM is to provide a source for Standard Date Elements (SDE), in direct support of NATO's Policy for Data Management. THE USE OF SDEs enhances interoperability among NATO C3 systems, facilitates increased data sharing, reduces data handling costs and leads to better data accuracy, consistency and timeliness.The NATO CorpDM is a Joint data model and comprises:



* A Reference Model, which contains the semantic definitions of the SDEs, their inter-relationships and necessary information about data structures (eg: maximum field length, data types).

* View Models, which are project-centric data views encapsulating specific examples and combinations of the generic SDEs.

* Semantics and structure of meta data.

The NATO C3 Repository is a tool for Data Administration. It contains the NATO CorpDM with data management tools and an XML registry. Phase II is operational, allowing Intranet and Internet access to the Repository.

Version 2 of the NATO CorpDM is due for release at the end of 2001; this version will contain a richer set of air and maritime SDEs. In addition, several large projects are producing View Models that will be incorporated in the NATO CorpDM, and furt her enrichment of the supporting toolsets is planned. Diagram 1 shows examples of the relationships between the various components and some of the major projects producing View Models.
