|description=The Transport Services correspond to resource-facing services, providing metro and wide-area connectivity to the Communications Access Services that operate at the edges of the network. In that role, Transport Services interact with the Transmission Services using them as the physical layer fabric supporting the transfer of data over a variety of transmission bearers as and where needed.

The Transport Services nomenclature is based on the type of end-to-end transport service supported over and/or within the "Core Network" (e.g. WAN, PCN). Possible types include point-point, point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-multipoint, routing/switching, multiplexing, etc.
