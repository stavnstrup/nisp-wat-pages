|title=SOA SMC Policy Enforcement Services
|description=The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Service Management and Control (SMC) Policy Enforcement Services enforce technical and business policies related to performance, quality of service, agreed service levels, and ensures compliance with business and legal rules. SOA SMC Policy Enforcement Services act as effectors that enforce policies at run-time.

SOA SMC Policy Enforcement Services enforce policies on services hosted within the SOA Platform. Depending on implementation, the SOA SMC Policy Enforcement Services can be standalone components in front of protected services (e.g. functioning like reverse proxy); or they can be part of the Web Hosting Platform (e.g. a pipeline in an application server).
