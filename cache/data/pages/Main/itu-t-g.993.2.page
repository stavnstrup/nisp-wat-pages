|description=
This document is an access technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that were originally deployed for POTS. It can be deployed from central offices, from fibre-fed cabinets located near the customer premises, or within buildings. VDSL2 is the newest and most advanced standard of DSL broadband wireline communications. Designed to support the wide deployment of triple play services such as voice, video, data, high definition television (HDTV) and interactive gaming, VDSL2 is purported to enable operators and carriers to gradually, flexibly, and cost-efficiently upgrade existing xDSL infrastructure.
