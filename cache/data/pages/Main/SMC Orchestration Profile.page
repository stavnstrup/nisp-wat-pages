|description=
The required conformance level for Service Management and Control Orchestration is "Level 1 conformance". This is defined in terms of implemented



* Mandatory data attributes

* Mandatory operations

* Mandatory filters and attribute selection

Level 1 conformance ensures that any two given federated Service Management System implementations of the SMC process APIs will be in practice interoperable with a core feature set. The core feature set is sufficient to enable incident, request, problem and change (process) handovers between Service Providers. Level 1 also provides updates to subscribed Service Providers when an incident, request, problem or change changes status. Implementers MAY implement higher levels of conformance.
