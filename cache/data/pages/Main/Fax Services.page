|description=The Fax Services provide the ability to send and receive bitmaps of electronic material (both text and images) using an analogue signal over a telephone network, normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device.
The telephone number of a receiving device is normally required to deliver the fax message across a telephone network. Alternatively, services using FoIP to deliver faxes across IP networks can extend fax delivery to multiple IP and email addressees.
