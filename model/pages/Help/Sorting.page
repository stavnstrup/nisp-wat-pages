==Introduction==
Sometimes data entities within Concepts have to be sorted in a particular order defined by the user.

In order to accomplish this, the Wiki Automation Tools allows user to enter a numeric value for each created data entity,
which is then used to sort stored records.

The sorting order is automatically applied in all queries generated by the tool for given Concept and thus all displayed data entities lists are sorted.


==Definition==
<pre>
<concept name="{CONCEPT}" ... ordered="{SORTED}">
  ...
</concept>
</pre>

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {CONCEPT}
| A short name of the Sorted Concept.
|-
! {SORTED}
| A Boolean flag indicating that data entities of given Concept should be sorted. Values: <nowiki>[true|false]</nowiki>. Default value: false.
|}


==Semantic database==
Sorted Concepts have additional property called "Order".

This property is used to sort data entities in all queries.


==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="User" ordered="true">
  <structure>
    <property name="Name"/>
    <property name="Flag"/>
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>

This will allow to sort Users by an arbitrary number instead of alphanumerical order of the names.

==User Interface==
The Edit Page of the Concept provides an additional numeric input field called "Order".
