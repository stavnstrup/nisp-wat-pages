The MIP Information Model (MIM) provides a common vocabulary for the Command and Control (C2) domain. More formally, the MIM is a semantic model for C2 information exchange. Its development is driven by the needs of the warfighters and its scope is defined by military information exchange requirements for multiple echelons in joint/combined response operations. The MIM embodies all the operational concepts of the JC3IEDM. Based on a few basic notions, such as «objects », «actions», and «meta data», the model provides semantically rich taxonomies of militarily relevant concepts. The MIM will allow the generation of diverse exchange specifications thus allowing its reuse across systems, interfaces and Communities of Interest.
