|description=
This STANAG specifically devoted to the TACOMS Mobile Subsystems, aims at defining the protocols required to support interoperability of a MS Network Element with either another MS Network Element or a WAS/LAS Network Element or a terminal.As defined in the TACOMS architecture schema, a very limited number of MS specific physical interfaces are identified for this TACOMS NE interoperability purpose.

According to the TACOMS interoperability concept, implementation of the MS equipment internal to the MS Network Element is left open and remains of national concern, this especially applies to the OTA links remaining out of TACOMS standardisation range.

Taking into account the MS specific constraints mainly due to the limited MS OTA bandwidth capabilities, and in coherence with the protocols standardised within the WAS-LAS NEs interoperability domain, this STANAG provides MS protocol stacks and attached specification or recommendation, able to support a basic set of end to end network services, across the TACOMS interfaces.
