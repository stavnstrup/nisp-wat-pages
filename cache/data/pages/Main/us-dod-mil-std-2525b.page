|description=
This standard applies to all DOD components directly or indirectly involved with C4I operations, system operations, system development, and training within the context of warfighting operations. MIL-STD-2525B will serve as the standard symbol set for all future DOD uses of C4I symbology. The standard can be applied to mapping/charting, weather, cockpit display, and engineering design symbology to the extent that it is usable by these communities. The standard will apply to all future use of symbols in two-dimensional and electronic display systems in C4I environments.MIL-STD-2525B combines the symbology from two separate usage domains, referred to as the "force domain" and the "engagement domain." These domains use warfighting symbology in support of their C4IFTW functions. When integrated, this symbology provides the basis for a final standard solution for C4IFTW symbology.

Symbology used in the force domain has evolved from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 2019 (APP 6), "Military Symbols for Land Based Systems," and U.S. Army Field Manual (FM) 101-5-1/Marine Corp Reference Publication (MCRP) 5-2A, Operational Terms and Graphics. Commanders and staff at all echelons use the symbols and graphics contained in these documents for planning and execution of ground force military operations. These symbols represent units, installations, equipment, and operations, and are used in automated C4I systems or to mark maps and overlays manually.
