Web services are meaningful only if potential users may find information sufficient to permit their execution. The focus of UDDI is the definition of a set of services supporting the description and discovery of (1) business, organizations, and other Web service providers, (2) the Web services they make available, and (3) the technical interfaces which may be used to access those services. Based on a commom set of industry standards, including HTTP, XML, XML Schema, and SOAP, UDDI provides an interoperable, foundational infrastructure for a Web services-based software environment for both publicly available services and services only exposed internally within an oranization. This document describes the Web services and behaviours of all instances of a UDDI registry.Should not be used in a secure environment.
