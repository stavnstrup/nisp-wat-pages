|description=
The primary goal of the directory service DNS is to provide a consistent name space used for referring to system resources in such a manner that the name does not require network identifiers, addresses, routes or similar information. DNS can be considered as a large, distributed mailing list which has 3 major components consisting of the name space, name servers and name resolvers.
