==Introduction==
For each '''Concept''' the following security features can be enabled:

* '''Page protection'''
Concepts can be marked as 'protected', which means that pages which contain the records of this Concept shall be protected.
These pages shall be protected by the import scripts or manually by the users.
System displays an error message if such page is not protected.

* '''Permission to create new records'''
Creation of new records can be limited only to members of specific '''User Groups'''.
Such a group is defined via '''createPermission''' option. See [[Help:User Groups|User Groups]] for more information how to define User Groups.
