In an environment where data objects must have bound metadata, the resource identified in the URI will already contain a BDO (detached, encapsulating or embedded). As such, there is no requirement for metadata binding that is specific for REST. However, to support information sharing between partners it may be necessary to locate a Binding Data Object (BDO) in the HTTP protocol layer.
