|description=
Delta modulation (DM) is a 1-bit DPCM, namely a DPCM that uses only two levels (or 1 bit) to quantize the prediction error. This leads to very simple transmitter/receiver circuits, which is the primary attraction of DM. Clearly, neighboring signal samples must be highly correlated for DM to give an accurate approximation of the original. This means that signals must be sampled at rates much higher (typically 4-6) than needed for standard 8-bit DPCM.
