|description=
The MIP Information Model (MIM) provides the semantic foundation for information exchange in the Command and Control (C2) domain. Its development is driven by the needs of the warfighters and its scope is defined by military information exchange requirements for multiple echelons in joint/combined operations. The MIM embodies all the operational concepts of the JC3IEDM. Based on a few basic notions, such as «Object», «Action», and «Metadata», the model provides semantically rich taxonomies of militarily relevant concepts.
