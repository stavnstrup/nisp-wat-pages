|description=
XNFS includes the following standard NFS protocol specifications:

* RFC 3010:1989, NFS: Network File System protocol specification

* RFC 1014:1987, XDR: External data representation standard

* RFC 1057:1988, RPC: Remote procedure call protocol specification

While XDR and RPC are written as general-purpose specifications, their primary use is in the context of NFS. The XNFS specification also defines a number of additional protocols concerned with network monitoring and management and other features. XNFS allows UNIX workstations to access and share files located on remote platforms without the need to download/upload them (i.e. it supports a virtual filestore).

X/Open intends to adopt IEEE P1003.1f when it becomes a standard. P1003.1f is a draft POSIX operating system API for network transparent file access (TFA).
