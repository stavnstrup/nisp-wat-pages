|description=
The data format described in this document provides a means for the transmission of Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) detection data. It also offers a format for requesting surveillance service from the sensor and for receiving acknowledgment that the requested surveillance will or will not be performed. The GMTIF is a binary, message-oriented format for the prompt dissemination of MTI data. It may be sent as a stand-alone format or it may be embedded in a frameoriented format, such as the NATO Secondary Imagery Format (NSIF, STANAG 4545) or the National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF, MIL-STD-2500) for the dissemination of secondary imagery, or in a message-oriented format such as the NATO Primary Imagery Format (STANAG 7023) for the dissemination of primary imagery.
