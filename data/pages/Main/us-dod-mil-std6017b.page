The Variable Message Format (VMF) Military Standard (MIL-STD) provides military services and agencies with Joint interoperability standards, including message, data element, and protocol standards. These standards are essential for the design, development, test, certification, fielding, and continued operation of automated tactical data systems (TDSs) which support the requirement to exchange timely, critical, command and control information across Joint boundaries.
