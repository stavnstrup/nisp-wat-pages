This document defines the Standards Profile for Federated Mission Networking (FMN) Spiral 2. The FMN Standards Profiles provides a suite of interoperability standards and other standardized profiles for interoperability of selected community of interest services, core services and communications services in a federation of mission networks. It places the required interoperability requirements, standards and specifications in context for FMN Affiliates.

FMN Standards Profiles are generic specifications at a logical level. They allow for independent national technical service implementations, without the loss of essential interoperability aspects.

FMN is founded on a service-oriented approach. The interoperability standards applicable to these services are identified and specified in line with the NATO C3 Taxonomy.

The standards metadata in the document is harvested from several standards organizations. Not all organizations provide identification of standard editions and if they do, often only the latest version is available for the generation of the profiles. Edition numbers are documented in the implementation guidance for a respective profile and in the configuration settings of FMN Service Instructions, whenever and wherever relevant and appropriate.
