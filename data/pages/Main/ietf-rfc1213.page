|description=
This memo defines the second version of the Management Information Base (MIB-II) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure of management information (RFC 1155:1990) along with the network management protocol (RFC 1157:1990) for TCP/IP-based internets, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular the Internet community.
