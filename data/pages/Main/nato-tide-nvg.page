The NATO Vector Graphics (NVG) Data Format was created to ease the encoding and sharing of battle-space information between command and control systems with particular emphasis placed on military symbology. The data format is utilized in several NATO systems. Over the years a protocol evolved to support the discovery and acquisition of NVG data. The NATO Vector Graphics (NVG) Protocol is the formal specification of this protocol.
