|title=Wireless LOS Static Wideband Transmission Service
|description=The Wireless Line of Sight (LOS) Static Wideband Transmission Services support the wireless transfer of data amongst two or more static nodes within Line of Sight (LOS) of each other, employing modulated Radio Frequency (RF) carriers in different frequency bands, and employing wideband high capacity wireless terminals operating in the UHF frequency band, S band (2 to 4 GHz), C band (4 to 8 GHz) and NATO military band IV (4.4 to 5 GHz).

Examples of Wireless LOS Static Wideband Transmission Services are Point-to Point Microwave radio links, Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Tactical Highband Networking Waveform (HNW), and Future NATO Wideband Waveform (WBWF).
