|description=
The Satelllite Broadcast System (SBS) will provide NATO forces with high capacity satellite communications for strategic and tactical units. The aim of this STANAG is to define a baseline set of interfaces and protocols so that system integrators are able to build and commission interoperable SBS transmit and receive platforms using COTS based satellite broadcast technology and NATO approved HAIPIS-compliant Type-1 IP-encryption devices.
