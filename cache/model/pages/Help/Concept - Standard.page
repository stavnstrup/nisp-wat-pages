;Description
Standards are defined as "an acknowledged measure of comparison for quantitative or qualitative value. Compliance with a certain standard sets a degree or level of requirement, excellence, or attainment". In the context of Enterprise Mapping, these standards materialize as documents, publications or other files that set proportions to the referred objects.
		The concept is designed to store metadata of these standards, and only in rare cases a copy or transcript of the original standard is available. The articles reflect standards that are ratified by standardization organizations (like ISO, IEEE, IETF or W3C) or published in bulk after approval by a certain community (as is the case with NATO's Interoperability Standards and Profiles). The standards metadata that is available on the EM Wiki is updated on a regular basis.
