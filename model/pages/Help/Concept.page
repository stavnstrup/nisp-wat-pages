==Introduction==
A '''Concept''' defines a data entity type to be managed in the Wiki.

Each Concept is build from a set of '''Properties''' and '''Subobjects'''. See [[Help:Property|Property]] and [[Help:Subobject|Subobject]] for more details.


==Definition==
<pre>
<concept
    name="{CONCEPT NAME}" acronym="{CONCEPT ACRONYM}" plural="{CONCEPT PLURAL NAME}"
    type="{CONCEPT TYPE}" image="{CONCEPT IMAGE}" color="{CONCEPT COLOR}">

  <description>{CONCEPT DESCRIPTION}</description>

  <structure>
    <property name="{PROPERTY NAME}" .../>
    <property name="{PROPERTY NAME}" .../>
    <subobject name="{SUBOBJECT NAME}" .../>
    <subobject name="{SUBOBJECT NAME}" .../>
    ....
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>

|-
! {CONCEPT NAME}
| A short name of the Concept.
|-
! {CONCEPT ACRONYM}
| A short acronym of the Concept.
|-
! {CONCEPT PLURAL NAME}
| A plural name of the Concept.
|-
! {CONCEPT TYPE}
| A type the Concept. The attribute can have one of the following values:
* '''Dynamic''' for entities which are to be manually edited by the users through generated forms.
* '''Static''' for entities which are read-only (imported by the scripts).
* '''Internal''' for subobjects. See [[Help:Subobject|Subobject]] for more details.
* '''Virtual''' for abstract entities which are a base for other concrete Concepts. See [[Help:Inheritance|Inheritance]] for more details.
|-
! {CONCEPT IMAGE}
| A file with the Concept icon.
|-
! {CONCEPT COLOR}
| A color to be used on all pages associated with the Concept.
|-
! {CONCEPT DESCRIPTION}
| A long description of the Concept.
|-
! structure
| A definition of the Concept structure: a list of Concept Properties and various associated widgets to be used for the Concept.
|-
! {PROPERTY NAME}
| A short name of the Property. See [[Help:Property|Property]] for more details.
|-
! {SUBOBJECT NAME}
| A short name of the Subobject. See [[Help:Subobject|Subobject]] for more details.

==Extensions==
The following extensions extend basic Concept database model and capabilities (add/view/edit/search):
* [[Help:Inheritance|Inheritance]]
* [[Help:Mapping|Mapping]]
* [[Help:Page Names|Page Names]]
* [[Help:Hierarchical Data|Hierarchical Data]]
* [[Help:Sorting|Sorting]]
* [[Help:Concept Security|Security]]


==Semantic database==
The Concept meta-data are NOT being defined/represented in the semantic database.

Only data created using generated Concept forms are stored in the semantic database:
* Each data page represents one Concept Data Entity.
* Each Concept Data Entity is assigned to the Concept specific Category {CONCEPT PLURAL NAME}
* Each Concept Data Entity gets automatically assigned UUID (global unique identifier)
* Each Concept Data Entity stores a set of Concept properties


==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="Event" plural="Events" type="Dynamic" image="Event.png" color="f9f9f9">
  <structure>
    <property name="Title" mandatory="true"/>
    <property name="Description" mandatory="true"/>
    <property name="Start date"/>
    <property name="End date"/>
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>


==User Interface==
Based on the Concept definition the following pages are generated:
* '''Concept Meta-Model Page''' (Project:Concept - {CONCEPT NAME}), which displays Concept meta-model information, including
** Concept diagram
** list of all properties

* '''Concept List Page''' (Category:{CONCEPT NAME}), which displays the list of records of particular Concept

* '''Concept View Page''' (Template:{CONCEPT NAME}), which displays the details of one data record of particular Concept

* '''Concept Search Page''' (Form:{CONCEPT NAME}) Search Form, which allows to search data record of particular Concept based on any Concept property.
