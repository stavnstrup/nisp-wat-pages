==Introduction==
The '''Aggregation''' represents stronger form of the '''Association''' between two Concepts,
in which one Concept is an integral part of another Concept and can't exists without it.

The Composition has all of the futures of the [[Help:Page Property|Association]], and adds additional 'Add {SOURCE CONCEPT}' buttons
on the {TARGET CONCEPT} pages. This makes it easier for the user to add part/composite objects to the current page.


==Definition==

The Aggregation feature is activated through the '''"stereotype"''' attribute of the Association (Page Property) set to '''"aggregation"'''.

The Page Property which represents "aggregation" must be marked as '''mandatory="true" and multiplicity="one"'''.

<pre>
    <!-- Referred Concept -->
    <concept name="TARGET CONCEPT">
    </concept>

    <!-- Referring Concept -->
    <concept name="SOURCE CONCEPT">
      <structure>
        ...
        <property name="{REFERRING PROPERTY}" refersTo="{TARGET CONCEPT}"
                  mandatory="true" multiplicity="one"
                  stereotype="aggregation">
        ...
      </structure>
    </concept>
</pre>

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {SOURCE CONCEPT}
| A name of the Concept which refers to Target Concept.
|-
! {TARGET CONCEPT}
| A name of the Concept which is referred from the Source Concept.
|-
! {REFERRING PROPERTY}
| A name of the Property which refers to the Target Concept from the Source Concept.

==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="Enclave">
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
    <property name="Description"/>
    <property name="Classification"/>
    <reference name="Sites" refersFrom="Site" property="Is part of"/>
  </structure>
</concept>

<concept name="Site">
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
    <property name="Description"/>
    <property name="Is part of" refersTo="Enclave" mandatory="true" multiplicity="one" stereotype="aggregation"/>
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>

In the example above:
* ''Enclave'' represents a computer network
* ''Enclave'' is composed of several ''Sites'' (association ''"Is part of"'' from ''Site'' to ''Enclave'')
* Sites are very strongly associated with the Enclave: they can't exists without the Enclave, thus the association is marked as "aggregation"


==User Interface==
The Aggregation feature:
* adds [[Image:Concept Add Icon.png|20px]] '''Add {SOURCE CONCEPT}''' button in the Navigator widget of the {TARGET Concept}
* adds [[Image:Concept Add Icon.png|20px]] '''Add {SOURCE CONCEPT}''' button in the associated Reference widget on the {TARGET Concept} (if [[Help:Reference|Reference]] widget is defined for this association)
* upon clicking on the [[Image:Concept Add Icon.png|20px]] '''Add {SOURCE CONCEPT}''' button system opens the Edit Page for new {SOURCE Concept}.
: The value of the {REFERRING PROPERTY} Property is automatically set to the {TARGET Concept} page from which the Edit Page was opened.
