|description=
The function of this document, Allied Communication Publication (ACP) 133 (SUPP-1(A)), is to provide the Directory schema definition for ACP 133. In addition to providing the schema reference for ACP 133, this supplement provides sufficient technical detail to guide a developer in this schema’s implementation.This document is comprised mainly of a set of tables defining Attributes, Structure Rules, Object Class Hierarchy, Auxiliary Object Class and Structural Object Class relationships, and mappings between these Object Classes and ACP 133 attributes.

This document contains references to each Attribute’s source. That is, where the attribute is defined by ITU, RFC, ISO, ACP or other military and international standards. Implementers should refer to these standards for technical details not covered in this supplement.

This supplement has been intended to capture any further changes to the ACP 133 Directory schema, and will be modified as change requests, or extensions, to the schema are approved.
