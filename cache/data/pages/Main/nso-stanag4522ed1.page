|description=
The aim of this STANAG is to define the minimum interoperability modes for a NATO EHF MDR MILSATCOM system. This STANAG describes the EHF MDR signal, modulation, and data format parameters of the satellite data uplinks and downlinks. These standard data links are transmissions that can be used for tracking, commanding, or communications on the uplink and for telemetry, tracking, mission data, or communications on the downlink. When the requirements of the standard are incorporated in specifications and used to develop satellite data links, a basic commonality for the satellite and ground terminal processing equipment is established, and link interoperability is possible.
