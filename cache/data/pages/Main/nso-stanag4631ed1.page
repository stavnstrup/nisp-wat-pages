|description=
The aim of the STANAG is to define a profile for the use of the S/MIME protocols Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [ESS], for adding cryptographic services to messaging objects. For X.400 objects, this document supplements the two IETF Drafts ?Securing X.400 Content with S/MIME? [x400Wrap] and ?Transporting S/MIM Objects in X.400? [x400Transport].The S/MIME protocols Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [ESS], leave the vendors with many options that has to be agreed on in order to achieve interoperability. This document is a profile for the use of the standards [CMS] and [ESS], and describes which of the different elements of service that has to be present on origination and reception of a message, in order to claim conformance to this profile.

For X.400 contents (e.g. P22, P772), this document supplements the two IETF RFC Drafts ?Securing X.400 Content with S/MIME? [x400Wrap] an ?Transporting S/MIME Objects in X.400? [x400Transport].
