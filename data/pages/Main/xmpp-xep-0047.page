|description=
This document describes In-Band Bytestreams (IBB), an XMPP protocol extension that enables two entities to establish a virtual bytestream over which they can exchange Base64-encoded chunks of data over XMPP itself. Because IBB provides a generic bytestream, its usage is open-ended. To date it has been used as a fallback method for sending files (see SI File Transfer (XEP-0096) and Jingle File Transfer (XEP-0234)) when out-of-band methods such as SOCKS5 Bytestreams (XEP-0065) are not available. However, IBB could also be useful for any kind of relatively low-bandwidth activity, such as games, shell sessions, or encrypted text.
