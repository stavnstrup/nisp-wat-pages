|description=
This Recommendation gives functional characteristics of interfaces associated with:

* network nodes, in particular, synchronous digital multiplex equipment and digital exchanges in IDNs for telephony and ISDNs; and

* PCM multiplexing equipment.

It deals with basic frame structures, including details of frame length, frame alignment signals, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) procedures and other basic information.

It contains more specific information about how certain channels at 64 kbit/s and at other bit rates are accommodated within the basic frame structures.
