|description=
MIL-DTL-83526 is a military specification describing the characteristics, performance and testing criteria for an environmental resistant, hermaphroditic interface, fiber-optic circular connector. The connectors covered have a consistent and predictable optical performance using low loss optical fiber cables in military, ground based, fiber-optic data transmission systems, and are sufficiently rugged to withstand military field applications. This specification includes expanded-beam fiber-optic connectors.
