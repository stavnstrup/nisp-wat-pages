|description=
HTTP is a page-based search and retrieval protocol used by the World Wide Web (WWW) to transfer hypertext documents. HTTP uses links contained in HTML formatted documents to navigate between web resources. These links are based on Internet addresses known as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of the form "HTTP:// [ ... ]". The first part of the URL indicates the protocol used to access the web server, i.e. "HTTP", and the second part is the web domain name, e.g. "www.lycos.com". HTTP 1.1 described in IETF RFC 2616:1999 is upward compatible with the older version HTTP 1.0 as described in IETF RFC 1945:1996.
