|description=
Authentication and integrity algorithm for ?Sub Certification Authority and other PKI components (such as Key Recovery Agents)? as mandated by the interoperability protocol PCT for implementing digital signatures for a NATO Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in the NATO messaging system. PKCS#1 v2.1 provides recommendations for the implementation of public-key cryptography based on the RSA algorithm, covering

* Cryptographic primitives

* Encryption schemes

* Signature schemes with appendix

* ASN.1 syntax for representing keys and for identifying the schemes

The recommendations are intended for general application within computer and communications systems, and as such include a fair amount of flexibility. It is expected that application standards based on these specifications may include additional constraints. The recommendations are intended to be compatible with the standard IEEE-1363-2000 and draft standards currently being developed by the ANSI X9F1 and IEEE P1363 working groups.
