|description=
ISO/IEC 13818-1:2013 specifies the system layer of the coding. It was developed principally to support the combination of the video and audio coding methods defined in ISO/IEC 13818-2 and ISO/IEC 13818-3. The system layer supports six basic functions:

* the synchronization of multiple compressed streams on decoding;

* the interleaving of multiple compressed streams into a single stream;

* the initialization of buffering for decoding start up;

* continuous buffer management;

* time identification;

* multiplexing and signalling of various components in a system stream.
