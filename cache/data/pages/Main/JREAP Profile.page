|description=
The Joint Range Extension Application Protocol (JREAP) enables Link 16 tactical data to be transmitted over digital media and networks not originally designed for tactical data exchange. Full detail of JREAP instructions and procedures can be found in ATDLP-5.18(B)(1).

Link 16 messages (i.e. J-series) are embedded inside of the JREAP. JREAP management messages (i.e. X-series) are used, in order to ensure proper dissemination of the Link 16 messages.

Capabilities are provided that include:



* Extending the range-limited tactical networks to beyond LOS while reducing their dependence upon relay platforms

* Reducing the loading on stressed networks

* Providing backup communications in the event of the loss of the normal link

* Providing a connection to a platform that may not be equipped with the specialized communications equipment for that TDL.

For media that do not support OSI network and transport layers, the JREAP provides network and transport layer functionality. For media supporting OSI network and transport layers, the JREAP is encapsulated within those layers. JREAP software can be integrated into a host system or into a stand-alone processor. The appropriate interface terminals are required at each end of any JREAP alternate media link.

The SIMPLE protocol is going to be used only for Verification and Validation purpose of all systems employing or interfacing with tactical data links and only when the systems do not support JREAP. It is not going to be used within the operational network for operational purpose. STANAG 5602 covers ATDLP-6.02 (SIMPLE), which specifies the requirements for the transfer of data between remote sites to support the interoperability testing of tactical data link implementations in different platforms.
