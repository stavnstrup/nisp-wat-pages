|description=
The document describes the modulation and channel coding system (denoted the "System" for the purposes of the present document) for satellite digital multi-programme Television (TV)/High Definition Television (HDTV) services to be used for primary and secondary distribution in Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) bands. The System is intended to provide Direct-To-Home (DTH) services for consumer Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD), as well as collective antenna systems (Satellite Master Antenna Television (SMATV)) and cable television head-end stations, with a likelihood of remodulation, see EN 300 429 (bibliography).
