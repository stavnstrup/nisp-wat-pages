|description=
This document describes a preemption priority policy element for use by signaled policy based admission protocols (such as the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) and Common Open Policy Service (COPS).Preemption priority defines a relative importance (rank) within the set of flows competing to be admitted into the network. Rather than admitting flows by order of arrival (First Come First Admitted) network nodes may consider priorities to preempt some previously admitted low priority flows in order to make room for a newer, high- priority flow.

This document corrects an RSVP POLICY_DATA P-Type codepoint assignment error in RFC 2751.
