|description=
The NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles eXchange (NISPX) Specification provides a format for use in machine-to-machine message exchange and for file based exchange. NISPX is an XML grammar used to encode and transport representations of Interoperability Standards and Profile data. NISPX packages and their related files (if any) may be compressed using the ZIP format into single digital information objects (containers). This specification will be used by the IPCaT to publish selected NISP datasets electronically as a Trusted Data Source (TDS) and should be used by standardization groups and other responsible parties to submit standards and profiles for inclusion into the NISP.
