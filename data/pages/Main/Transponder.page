|description=A communications transponder, is the series of interconnected units which form a communications channel between the receiving and the transmitting antennas.

A transponder is typically composed of:
* An input band limiting device (a band pass filter)
* An input low-noise amplifier (LNA), designed to amplify the signals received from the surface/ground station
* frequency translator used to convert the frequency of the received signal to the frequency required for the transmitted signal
* An output band pass filter
* A power amplifier 

Most transponders operate on a "bent pipe" principle, sending back of what goes into the conduit with only amplification and a shift from uplink to downlink frequency. However, more advanced radio relay stations can also perform processing, where the signal is demodulated, decoded, and then re-encoded and modulated within the radio relay station. This type of transponder , a 'regenerative' transponder, has many advantages but it is much more complex.

Transponders are part of a radio relay station. Those radio relay stations are typically part of Communications-Satellites (low earth orbit 100-1240 miles), or are mountend on High or Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE > 30.000 feet/MALE 10.000-30.000 feet) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that can stay airborne for extended durations of time, typically 24 to 48 hours.
