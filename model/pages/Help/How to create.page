<noinclude>{{User Manual Navigator|How to contribute}}</noinclude>
Contribution to the {{SITENAME}} Wiki usually means one of two things: either edit an existing article or create a new one. Creating a new article can be done in several ways. For instance, one can add the new page name for the article in the [[Help:How to search|search bar]] and when such page doesn't exist, the search result will display an option to "Create the page "your page name" on this wiki!". You follow that link and start typing. However, we can assume that most of the new contributions to the {{SITENAME}} Wiki are additions to existing concepts, which means that a form is available. In those cases, the [[Help:Forms|appropriate form]] should be used to create an article.

; Forms
{{:Help:Forms}}

The entry in the opening page of a form reflects the intended page name of the corresponding article. If such page name already exists, that page will be opened. If not, the form opens to create input for a new page of the associated concept. The concept has one of more templates to define the values of properties, the semantic relations and the design of the wiki page. The form is based on these templates and its purpose is to fill the fields of the template with user input.

; Nomenclature
For most of the concepts there is a strict naming convention. Names in the {{SITENAME}} Wiki have to be meaningful and unambiguous. Some subjects are covered in several concepts, for instance, because they have particular relevance in a business process, an information product and a user application. Therefore, it is important to follow the naming conventions.

Some of the naming conventions prescribe the final words in a page name and wether they are in singular or plural form. Other naming conventions describe the start of a page name, using an acronym or other prefix and an identifier such as a number, with to without leading zeros. Those naming conventions are specified for each concept and explained on the associated form.

; Coordination
A new page will assume its place in the set of articles based upon the values for internal links, categories and semantic relations. In exceptional cases, a new page or a considerable change in an existing page can lead to a break in the design or the functionality, which causes an interrupt in the user experience. {{#ifeq:{{SITENAME}}|EM|For instance, this may lead to an unintended change the <span class="plainlinks">[{{SERVER}}{{SCRIPTPATH}}/perspectives/Governance/{{urlencode:C3 Taxonomy Poster.pdf|PATH}} C3 Taxonomy poster]</span> or the <span class="plainlinks">[{{SERVER}}{{SCRIPTPATH}}/perspectives/Governance/{{urlencode:C3 Technical Services Taxonomy Poster.pdf|PATH}} C3 Technical Services Taxonomy poster]</span>.}} In any case that a new article or a change or content could lead to a dispute within a stakeholder community, it is best advised to submit an issue to discuss this subject before such an article is created. When in doubt, users can contact the [[Help:Support|support team]] in the THF Branch.
