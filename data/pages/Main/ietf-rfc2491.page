|description=
This document describes a general architecture for IPv6 over NBMA networks. It forms the basis for subsidiary companion documents that describe details for various specific NBMA technologies (such as ATM or Frame Relay). The IPv6 over NBMA architecture allows conventional host-side operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol, while also supporting the establishment of 'shortcut' NBMA forwarding paths when dynamically signaled NBMA links are available. Operations over administratively configured Point to Point NBMA links are also described.Dynamic NBMA shortcuts are achieved through the use of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol operation within Logical Links, and inter-router NHRP for the discovery of off-Link NBMA destinations. Both flow-triggered and explicitly source-triggered shortcuts are supported.
