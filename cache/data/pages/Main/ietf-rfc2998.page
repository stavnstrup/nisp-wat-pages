|description=
The Integrated Services (Intserv) architecture provides a means for the delivery of end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) to applications over heterogeneous networks. To support this end-to-end model, the Intserv architecture must be supported over a wide variety of different types of network elements. In this context, a network that supports Differentiated Services (Diffserv) may be viewed as a network element in the total end-to-end path. This document describes a framework by which Integrated Services may be supported over Diffserv networks.
