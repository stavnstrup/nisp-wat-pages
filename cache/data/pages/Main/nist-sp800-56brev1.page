|description=
This Recommendation provides the specifications of key-establishment schemes that are appropriate for use by the U.S. Federal Government, based on a standard developed by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9, Inc.: ANS X9.44, Key Establishment using Integer Factorization Cryptography [ANS X9.44]. A key-establishment scheme can be characterized as either a key-agreement scheme or a key-transport scheme. This Recommendation provides asymmetric-based key-agreement and key-transport schemes that are based on the Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm. When there are differences between this Recommendation and the referenced ANS X9.44 [ANS X9.44] standard, this key-establishment schemes Recommendation shall have precedence for U.S. Government applications.
