Communication Systems are systems or facilities for transferring data between persons and equipment. They usually consists of a collection of communication networks, transmission systems, relay stations, tributary stations and terminal equipment capable of interconnection and inter-operation so as to form an integrated whole. These individual components must serve a common purpose, be technically compatible, employ common procedures, respond to some form of control and generally operate in unison.

Information Systems are integrated sets of components for collecting, storing, and processing data for delivering information, and digital products. Organizations and individuals rely on information systems to manage their operations, supply services, and augment personal lives.
