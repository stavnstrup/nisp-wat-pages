This document details the most commonly used specifications managed by the TIDE community. The specifications presented here have been proven through years of experimentation by many NATO and National systems. More recently these specifications are being used by operational systems. From a technical perspective, the reuse of these specifications is an indicator of their success and by extrapolation the success of the TIDE process. As a consequence of this success greater care must now be taken in the management and evolution of these specifications. The TIDE Transformational Baseline documents are intended to formalize the underlying specification while opening them up to the broader technical community.The specifications documented here are general in nature and can be easily implemented and made useful by nearly all network enabled systems and software. The following sections discuss the applicability of these specifications from both a technical and operational perspective.
