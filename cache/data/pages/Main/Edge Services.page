|description=The Edge Transport Services provide the delivery or exchange of traffic flows over different Transmission Services. The traffic flows are formatted and delivered by the Communications Access Services at the edges of the network. This "edge" in Edge Transport is the Wide Area Network (WAN) edge (i.e. the provider edge). In Protected Core Networking (PCN) terms, the edge can be considered as the entry point into the protected core.

The Edge Transport Services category can be broken down into service classes that closely follow the OSI stack. The main difference between Communication Access Services and Edge Transport Services is that the latter are resource-facing, and are streamlined for the efficient transfer of larger volumes of traffic resulting from the aggregation of multiple Communications Access Services.

Edge Transport Services can implement encryption for link security and traffic flow confidentiality protection (LINKSEC).
