|description=
ISO/IEC 13818-11:2004 specifies IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) on the MPEG-2 system. MPEG-2 IPMP offers flexibility, robustness and interoperability, which allows the secure content delivery in the MPEG-2 system. MPEG-2 IPMP can be used in combination with proprietary IPMP tools, which enables the implementation to various degrees of security for different business models, while maintaining the interoperability.ISO/IEC 13818-11:2004 specifies:



* syntax and semantics for IPMP control information which includes tool list, tool container and rights container;

* syntax and semantics for IPMP descriptors, which facilitates IPMP protection signalling;

* syntax and semantics of IPMP data extending from the common base class IPMP_Data_BaseClass to support the following functionalities:

* mutual authentication for IPMP tool to IPMP tool as well as IPMP tool to terminal communication,

* the requesting by IPMP tools of the connection/disconnection to requested IPMP tools,

* the notification to IPMP tools of the connection/disconnection of IPMP tools,

* common IPMP processing,

* IPMP tool to/from user interaction;

* syntax and semantics for IPMP information carriage to and from IPMP tools;

* syntax and semantics for the request and transfer of content and IPMP tools between terminals;

* XML syntax and semantics for the description of the environment in which the MPEG-2 terminal/application is operating;

* a list of registration authorities required for the support of the specifications found herein.
