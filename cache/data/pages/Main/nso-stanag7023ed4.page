|description=
This STANAG establishes a standard data format and a standard transport architecture for the transfer of reconnaissance and surveillance imagery and associated auxiliary data between reconnaissance collection systems and exploitation systems. The concept behind STANAG 7023 is to describe the sensor data structure in a space-time domain. This enables STANAG 7023 to describe any sensor data structure without modification to the STANAG. STANAG 7023 is capable of handling any type of sensor. It is simply a shell for capturing multi-source data for the purpose of data correlation at a later time and place. It is also possible from a STANAG 7023 data stream to replicate events in precisely the same order in which they occurred at acquisition.
