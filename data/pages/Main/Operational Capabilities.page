|description=The "Operational Capabilities" layer in the C3 Taxonomy represents all the capabilities required by the Alliance for the successful completion of missions - stated in Mission Types and refined in Key Tasks - and the achievement of stated ambitions. Operational Capabilities are captured in a Capability Hierarchy Framework (CHF) and are expressed as a set of Capability Codes and Statements (CC/CS). In the same way as the Key Tasks are further refined in Business Processes and their related Information Products, the Capability Codes and Statements are materialized by means of the User-Facing Capabilities (Applications and Equipment).
