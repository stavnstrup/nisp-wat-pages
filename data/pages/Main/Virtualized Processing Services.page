|description=The Virtualized Processing Services hide the physical characteristics of a processing platform and instead present abstracted processing platform to the consumer. 

Virtualization enables the provisioning of simplified, fit-for-purpose, tailor-made and on-demand IT-infrastructure resources, sparing the user from having to understand and manage complex details of IT-infrastructure resources. This service supports the centralization of management and maintenance while more flexibly and efficiently allocating IT-infrastructure resources.
