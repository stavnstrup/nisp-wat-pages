|title=Transmission Security Services
|description=The Transmission Security Services provide Transmission Security (TRANSEC) which is a component of Communications Security (COMSEC). TRANSEC measures are designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis. TRANSEC aims to achive low probability of interception (LPI); low probability of detection (LPD); and antijamming (EPM or ECCM).

TRANSEC methods include frequency hopping and spread spectrum where the required pseudorandom sequence generation is controlled by a cryptographic algorithm and key.
