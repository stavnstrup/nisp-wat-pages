==Introduction==
The Wiki Platform enforces an authentication of every user accessing Wiki instances.

The Wiki Platform maintains an LDAP repository with all registered user accounts.
The LDAP repository is shared by all Wiki instances created within the Wiki Platform.

This means that every Wiki user needs to be registered and has an account created before the first access.

By default all registered users are granted an access to all hosted Wikis instances.

It is possible to limit the access to specific Wiki instance only for the users belonging to the specific LDAP group.
