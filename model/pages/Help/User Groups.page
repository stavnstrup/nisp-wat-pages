==Introduction==
The Wiki User Groups '''enable more granular access control to various parts of user pages''' through the Wiki Model definitions.

They define lists of Wiki user accounts (see [[Help:Wiki Access Control|Wiki Access Control]])
for which detailed permissions might be set, e.g:
* to see protected parts of the View Page (see [[Help:Conditional|Conditional]]),
* to enable editing of the protected parts of the form on the Edit Page (see [[Help:Conditional|Conditional]]),
* control an access to Workflow transitions/actions. (see [[Help:Workflow Access Control|Workflow Access Control]])
* control which users can create new records for specific Concepts (see [[Help:Concept Security|Concept Security]])

The User Groups are defined within Wiki instances on a separate data pages (through dedicated View and Edit Pages).
They are NOT related to LDAP groups.

The User Groups are defined in the context of specific Concepts for which there is a need of more granular access control.

See [[Help:Conditional|Conditional]] and [[Help:Workflow Property|Workflow Property]]
how User Groups are further referred in the Wiki model.


==Definition==
'''NOTE: The model should import "../../MDA/WikiManagementModel.xml" package, which contains the definition of a User Group concept.'''

<pre>
<import model="../../MDA/WikiManagementModel.xml"/>

<concept name="{CONCEPT}">
  <structure>
  </structure>

  <userGroup name="{NAME}" label="{LABEL}">{DESCRIPTION}</userGroup>
</concept>
</pre>


{| class="helptable"
|-
! {CONCEPT}
| A name of the Concept in which context the User Group is to be created.
|-
! {NAME}
| A name of the User Group. The name should end up with the "User Group" suffix.
A name of the User Group might be a combination of:
* static text (e.g. "Event Analysts User Group"),
* given Concept property values (e.g. "${Is tested during} Analyst User Group",
which is dynamically translated to "CWIX 2018 Analyst User Group" for the Event called "CWIX 2018").

Note: User Groups are defined globally, which means that it is enough to define it once in the context of the entire model.
|-
! {LABEL}
| A label of the User Group to be displayed on the page. If omitted the {NAME} is used.
|-
! {DESCRIPTION}
| A description of the User Group.
|}


==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="Event">
  <structure>
  </structure>

  <userGroup name="{{PAGENAME}} Analysts User Group" label="Analysts User Group">Event Analysts</userGroup>
  <userGroup name="Admins User Group" label="Admin User Group">Event Admin</userGroup>
</concept>

<concept name="Test Case"">
  <structure>
      <property name="Is tested during" mandatory="true" multiplicity="one" stereotype="composition"/>
  </structure>

  <userGroup name="${Is tested during} Analysts User Group" label="Analysts User Group">Event Analysts</userGroup>
</concept>
</pre>


==User Interface==
Each User Group is defined on a separate page (with own View Page and Edit Page).
The list of all User Groups is displayed on the [[:Category:User Groups]] page.

The link to the User Group page is provided in the Concept Navigator Widget
Since the name of the User Group might contain values of displayed entity properties the link to that page
is displayed only on the entity View Page.

Initially when the User Group page doesn't exists, the red link is displayed.
After clicking on the red link system opens the User Group form where the details of the User Group might be defined.
The name of that page is pre-defined and can't be changed.

It is important to protect that page after it is created, so only administrators could modify its content.
