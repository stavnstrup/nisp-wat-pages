The aim of this agreement is to promote interoperability for the exchange of data among North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems. The NATO Imagery Interpretability Rating Scales allow for the evaluation of imagery quality and use of a consistent measure for such evaluations. Imagery deposited in libraries can be accessed with confidence in the consistency of quality measures.
