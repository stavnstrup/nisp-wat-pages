|description=The Presence Services advertise the network availability of other entities hence providing the knowledge of whether those entities are online and available for communication. Presence Services manage a subscription model, in effect a simple publish-subscribe method, whereby entities that have subscribed to another entity's presence receive updated presence information when that entity comes online and goes offline.
