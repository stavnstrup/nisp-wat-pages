==Introduction==
The '''Gantt Chart''' widget allows to '''display a Gantt Chart based on the data stored in the Wiki'''.

The chart is configured using Wiki Automation Tool well-known Concept called '''team:Task'''.

In order to generate a chart for any Concept defined in the Wiki Model, such Concept needs to be mapped to the '''team::Task''' Concept.
See [[Help:Mapping|Mapping]] for more details.

<pre>
<concept name="{CONCEPT}">
  <structure>
    <property name="{CONCEPT PROPERTY}"
    <property name="{CONCEPT PROPERTY}"

==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="User" >
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
  </structure>
</concept>

<concept name="Enclave" >
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
  </structure>
</concept>

<concept name="Event" >
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
    <property name="Description"/>
    <property name="Start date"/>
    <property name="End date"/>
    <property name="Is executed on" refersTo="Enclave">
    <property name="Is lead by" refersTo="User">
  </structure>

  <conceptMapping name="team::Task">
    <propertyMapping name="Label" property="Title"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Start" property="Start date"/>
    <propertyMapping name="End" property="End date"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Resource" value="CIAV"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Unit" value="quarter"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Open Levels" value="3"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Notes" property="Description"/>
    <propertyMapping name="Caption" value="Resource"/>
  </conceptMapping>
</concept>
</pre>

In the example above the "Event" Concept is mapped to well-known Concept in Wiki Automation Tool: '''"team::Task"'''.
The Gantt Chart will be displayed on the ''Enclave'' View Page and will display the list of events executed on that enclave.
The Gantt Chart will be displayed on the ''User'' View Page and will display the list of events lead by that user.


==User Interface==
The "Gantt Widget" is automatically displayed on the View Pages of the Concepts which are referred from the Concept mapped to the ''team::Task'' Concept.
