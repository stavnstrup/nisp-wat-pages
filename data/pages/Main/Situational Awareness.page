|description=The "Situational Awareness (SA)" is composed of a collection of information products that are processed and created for the perception of environmental elements with respect to time and/or space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status, affecting the safe, expedient and effective conduct of the mission. Situational Awareness involves being aware of what is happening in the vicinity to understand how information, events, and one's own actions will impact goals and objectives, both immediately and in the near future. It provides critical information to decision-makers in complex, dynamic areas such as military command and control.
