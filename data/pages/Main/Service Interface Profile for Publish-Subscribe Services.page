This document gives directives along with clarifications and amendments to the [OASIS WS-BaseNotification, 2006] and [OASIS WS-BrokeredNotification, 2006] specification on how to implement a notification broker/subscription manager to promote interoperability between the publish/subscribe engines and generic message subscribers. Some extensions to the protocol have been introduced in order to meet NATO requirements.
