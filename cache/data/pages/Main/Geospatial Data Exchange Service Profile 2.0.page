|description=
Maps, geographical overviews and digital images provide valuable knowledge of a mission area and are intensively used for planning and mission execution purposes at every level of command. Geospatial information (GI) requirements are typically defined by product type (what is required - the level of detail at a specific scale) and coverage (where it is required). Geospatial support covers land, sea and air-space (battle space) segments and consists of four main product types: topographical, hydrographical, aeronautical information and suitable geospatially referenced imagery.

Typically, maps and geospatial1 datasets are being produced by different organisations and need to be exchanged (e.g. via automated or manual file transfer) between different participants using standardised exchange formats. These datasets would then be loaded into specialised geospatial information systems (GIS) and published via standardized Web Services.

File geodatabases store geospatial datasets and can hold any number of these large, individual datasets. File geodatabases can be used across multiple platforms. Users are rapidly adopting file geodatabases in place of using legacy shapefiles.
