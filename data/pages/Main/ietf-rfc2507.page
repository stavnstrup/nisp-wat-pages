|description=
This document describes how to compress multiple IP headers and TCP and UDP headers per hop over point to point links. The methods can be applied to of IPv6 base and extension headers, IPv4 headers, TCP and UDP headers, and encapsulated IPv6 and IPv4 headers.Headers of typical UDP or TCP packets can be compressed down to 4-7 octets including the 2 octet UDP or TCP checksum. This largely removes the negative impact of large IP headers and allows efficient use of bandwidth on low and medium speed links.

The compression algorithms are specifically designed to work well over links with nontrivial packet-loss rates. Several wireless and modem technologies result in such links.
