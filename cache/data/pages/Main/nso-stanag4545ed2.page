|description=
This STANAG promotes interoperability for the exchange of Secondary Imagery among North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Command Control Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Systems. The NATO Secondary Imagery Format (NSIF) is the standard for formatting digital imagery files and imagery-related products and exchanging them among NATO members. The NSIF is part of a collection of related standards and specifications, known as the NATO ISR Interoperability Architecture (NIIA), developed to provide a foundation for interoperability in the dissemination of intelligence-related products among different computer systems.
