==Introduction==

The '''Dashboards''' allow to build separate pages to display customized content related to specific Concepts.
The content might contain any Widgets which can be placed on the regular concept view page.

==Definition==
<pre>
<concept name="{CONCEPT NAME}" ...>
  <structure>
    ....
  </structure>

  <dashboards>

    <dashboard name="{DASHBOARD NAME}" label={DASHBOARD LABEL} icon="{DASHBOARD ICON}" printableView="{DASHBOARD VIEW}" context="{DASHBOARD CONTEXT}" layout="{DASHBOARD LAYOUT}">
      <{WIDGET}>
      <{WIDGET}>
      <{WIDGET}>
      ...

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {DASHBOARD NAME}
| A unique name of the dashboard
|-
! {DASHBOARD LABEL}
| A label of the dashboard.
|-
! {DASHBOARD ICON}
| A icon of the dashboard.
|-
! {DASHBOARD VIEW}
| A boolean flag indicating if  of the dashboard should be display in printable mode.
|-
! {DASHBOARD CONTEXT}
| By default all dashboards are displayed in the context of the page from which they were invoked (e.g. Exercise dashboard in context of Exercise).
Sometimes it might be desired to changed the context of the dashboard to another page (e.g. in from Exercise Analysis Working Group page to Exercise).
The {DASHBOARD CONTEXT} allows to define a property of the current page which should be used as a new context for the dashboard.
E.g. in case of Exercise Analysis Working Group this property might specify "Is part of" to switch the context to Exercise)
|-
! {DASHBOARD LAYOUT}
| A layout of the dashboard. Identical as layouts for Groups.
