The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) describes an architecture for a service-oriented grid computing environment for business and scientific use, developed within the Global Grid Forum (GGF). OGSA is based on several other Web service technologies, notably WSDL and SOAP, but it aims to be largely agnostic in relation to the transport-level handling of data. (Definition from Wikipedia)
