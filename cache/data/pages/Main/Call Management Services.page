|title=Call Management Services
|description=The Call Management Services provide the means to design and implement rules and parameters governing the routing of inbound telephone calls through a network. These rules determine how calls are distributed according to the time and/or date of the call as well as the location of the caller (usually defined by the outbound Caller ID).  Call Management Services also incorporate the use of calling features such as Call Queues, IVR Menus, Hunt Groups and Recorded Announcements to provide a customised experience for the user and to maximize the efficiency of inbound call handling.
