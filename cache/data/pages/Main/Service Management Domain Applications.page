|title=Service Management Domain Applications
|description=The Service Management Domain Applications enable users to focus on the knowledge of services (e.g. voice; data, content services, etc.) and includes all functionality necessary for the management and operations of communications and information services required by or proposed to customers. The focus is on service delivery and management as opposed to the management of the underlying network and information technology. Some of the functions involve short-term service capacity planning; the application of a service design to specific customers or managing service improvement initiatives. These functions are closely connected with the day-to-day customer experience.
