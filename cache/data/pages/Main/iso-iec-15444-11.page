|description=
ISO/IEC 15444-11:2007 provides a syntax that allows JPEG 2000 coded image data to be protected for transmission over wireless channels and networks. Protection services include error detection and correction capability for header and bitstream, description of the error sensitivity of different portions of the compressed data, and description of possible residual errors in the compressed data. The syntax allows these protection services to be applied to coded image data in part or in their entirety. These services are designed so as to maintain the inherent features of JPEG 2000, such as scalability and access to various spatial areas, resolution levels, colour components and quality layers, while providing protection services on these elements.
