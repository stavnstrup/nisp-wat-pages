|description=
This document specifies a speech codec suitable for robust voice communication over IP. The codec is developed by Global IP Sound (GIPS). It is designed for narrow band speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s for 30 ms frames and 15.20 kbit/s for 20 ms frames. The codec enables graceful speech quality degradation in the case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.
