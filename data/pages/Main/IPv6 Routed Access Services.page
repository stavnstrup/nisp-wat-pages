|title=IPv6 Routed Access Services
|description=The IPv6 Routed Access Services provide the delivery or exchange of IP version 6 packets, subject to dynamic, destination-based routing, based on different routing protocols (each protocol is associated to a Service Type, i.e. an implementation option). The userâ€™s IP v6 address range is assigned by the provider of the Access Service.

Each routing protocol is associated to a service type (i.e. an implementation option for the provider). Examples of IPv6 Routed Access Services implementation options are Static routing, Link-state Unicast routing  (e.g. RIP, EIGRP), Distance-vector Unicast routing (OSPF), Path-vector Unicast routing (BGP), Policy-based Unicast routing (PBR), Multicast routing, and Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (MANET, e.g. OLSR-based).
