==Introduction==
The '''Composition''' represents stronger form of the '''[[Help:Aggregation|Aggregation]]''' and '''[[Help:Page Property|Association]]''' between two Concepts,
in which one Concept is an integral part of another Concept and can't exists without it.

The Composition has all of the futures of the [[Help:Aggregation|Aggregation]], but removes the capability to add new instance of the composed object from outside of the parent/owner object.


==Definition==

The Composition feature is activated through the '''"stereotype"''' attribute of the Association (Page Property) set to '''"composition"'''.

<pre>
    <!-- Referred Concept -->
    <concept name="TARGET CONCEPT">
    </concept>

    <!-- Referring Concept -->
    <concept name="SOURCE CONCEPT">
      <structure>
        ...
        <property name="{REFERRING PROPERTY}" refersTo="{TARGET CONCEPT}"
                  mandatory="true" multiplicity="one"
                  stereotype="composition">
        ...
      </structure>
    </concept>
</pre>

{| class="helptable"
|-
! {SOURCE CONCEPT}
| A name of the Concept which refers to Target Concept.
|-
! {TARGET CONCEPT}
| A name of the Concept which is referred from the Source Concept.
|-
! {REFERRING PROPERTY}
| A name of the Property which refers to the Target Concept from the Source Concept.

Not applicable.


==Example==
<pre>
<concept name="Enclave">
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
    <property name="Description"/>
    <property name="Classification"/>
    <reference name="Sites" refersFrom="Site" property="Is part of"/>
  </structure>
</concept>

<concept name="Site">
  <structure>
    <property name="Title"/>
    <property name="Description"/>
    <property name="Is part of" refersTo="Enclave" mandatory="true" multiplicity="one" stereotype="composition"/>
  </structure>
</concept>
</pre>

In the example above:
* ''Enclave'' represents a computer network
* ''Enclave'' is composed of several ''Sites'' (association ''"Is part of"'' from ''Site'' to ''Enclave'')
* Sites are very strongly associated with the Enclave: they can't exists without the Enclave, thus the association is marked as "aggregation"


==User Interface==
The Aggregation feature implements all behavior of the [[Help:Aggregation|Aggregation]] and:
* removes the [[Image:Concept Add Icon.png|20px]] '''Add new''' button on
** {{SOURCE CONCEPT}} Navigator
** all Meta-model Pages
