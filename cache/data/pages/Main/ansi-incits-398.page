This standard (revision of ANSI INCITS 398-2005) specifies a common set of data elements necessary to support multiple biometric technologies and to promote interoperability of biometric-based application programs and systems by allowing for biometric data exchange. These common data elements can be placed in a single file, record, or data object used to exchange biometric information between different system components and applications. This standard specifies the biometric data elements.
