|description=
BPMN is "a meta-language for the modeling of business processes. BPMN provides an abstracted execution model for collaborative and transactional business processes that span multiple applications and business partners, behind the firewall and over the Internet,across multiple verticals." BMPN provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes.
