|description=
Because the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) publishes a relatively large number of protocol specifications (see XMPP Extension Protocols (XEP-0001)), it is important to keep track of the namespaces defined by those specifications as well as the parameters used in the context of the relevant protocols. (Examples of such parameters include the features and options used in Feature Negotiation (XEP-0020) and the identities and features used in Service Discovery (XEP-0030).) In particular, the common use of protocols published by the XSF requires that namespaces and particular parameter values be assigned uniquely. It is the role of the XMPP Registrar to make those unique assignments and to maintain registries of the currently assigned values. The XMPP Registrar shall also function as a single point of contact between the XMPP Standards Foundation and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
