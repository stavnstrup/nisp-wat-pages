==Themes==

The look and feel of the Wikis is defined through the '''themes'''.

WAT provides two predefined framework themes:
* pluton (default)
* mars
which define different styling of the widgets, panels, etc. displayed on the pages.

The theme might be declared in the WikiModel element:

<pre>
<WikiModel xmlns="http://tide.act.nato.int/team/wat"
	name="CWIX" image="CWUX.png" theme="mars">
...
</WikiModel>
</pre>

The themes provide set of CSS files, which might be further customized in the project (see sections below).


==CSS customizations==
It's possible to customize the look-and-feel of the widgets by providing customized versions of the CSS styles defined in framework themes.

The classes which might be a primary target for customizations include styles defined in the following files:
* '''panel.css''' (defines style for all portal and grid panels)
* '''grid.css''' (defines overall layout of grid layout)
* '''portal.css''' (defines overall layout of portal layout)
* '''wikitable.css''' (defines layout of the standard table)

Note that it is possible to customize visulization of these widgets on regular pages (files in '''pages''' folder), but also on dashboard pages (files in '''print'' folder).

There are two methods to customize these CSS styles:
* Overwrite entire file
* Overwrite single property (preferred)


== Overwrite entire file ==
* Copy the source CSS file from $WAT/css/(pages|print) folder to $WIKIPROJECT/css/(pages/print) folder (e.g. panel.css)
* Modify the content of this file to specific needs
* During deployment (when running wat command line), the customized file will REPLACE the source file in the Wiki installation

;Example of customized panel.css file
<pre>
div.panel {
  border:1px solid #989ea5;
}
div.panel > div:first-child {
  border-bottom:1px solid #989ea5;
	background-color:#90bdde;
  color:white;
  text-align:left;
  font-size: 12pt;
  font-weight:bold;
  padding:4px;
}

div.panel > div:nth-child(2) {
  padding:5px;
}
</pre>

and the same file for print (to remove all borders, title background, centering background):

<pre>
div.panel {
  border:0px solid #989ea5;
}
div.panel > div:first-child {
  border-bottom:0px solid #989ea5;
	background-color:white;
  color:black;
  text-align:center;
  font-size: 18pt;
  font-weight:bold;
  padding:4px;
}

div.panel > div:nth-child(2) {
  padding:5px;
}
</pre>


==Overwrite single property==
* Create a new file in the $WIKIPROJECT/css/(pages/print) folder. Make sure that the name doesn't overlap with any of the files in the $WAT/css folder.
* Provide required customization.
** NOTE: it is required to append '''!important''' flag to overwrite standard settings
* During deployment (when running wat command line), the customized file will will be APPENDED to the MediaWiki:Common.css (or Print.css)

;Example: to change the color of panel background, create panel-pink.css file
<pre>
div.panel:before {
  background-color:pink !important;
}
</pre>
