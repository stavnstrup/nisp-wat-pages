|description=
This document presents a set of extensions for supporting generic policy based admission control in RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension to the RSVP functional specifications.These extensions include the standard format of POLICY_DATA objects, and a description of RSVP's handling of policy events.

This document does not advocate particular policy control mechanisms; however, a Router/Server Policy Protocol description for these extensions can be found in RAP, COPS, COPS-RSVP.
